After seeing so many Hexo themes, I couldn't help but feel itchy to create one myself. As the saying goes, **all beginnings are hard**, and it seems I only know HTML, CSS, and JS. I don't understand Node.js or ES6, but that's okay; I can learn as I go.

+ Built the overall architecture.
+ Simple design of the top navigation bar CSS.
+ Drew a simple Logo.
