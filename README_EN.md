Why not do something when idle? After seeing so many Hexo themes, I couldn't help but itch to create one myself. As the saying goes, **the beginning is the hardest part**, and I only know HTML, CSS, and JS. Node.js, ESJ, and the like are indeed unfamiliar, but no problem, learn as I go.

+ Built the overall structure
+ Simple CSS design for the top navigation bar
+ Drew a simple Logo
